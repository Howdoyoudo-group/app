- Fixed `fetch-industry-events` and `scrape-jobs-in-football` WORKER_RESOURCE_LIMIT crashes
- Connected `www.howdoyoudo.co.uk` to Vercel — site is live

- Fixed promo video and voxpops video (Supabase Storage / Lovable CDN)
- Fixed onboarding blank screen bug after completion

- Imported 26,918 jobs from Lovable CSV export — now 25,694 live jobs
- Switched 123-reg nameservers from GoDaddy to 123-reg (fixes bare domain hitting Lovable)
- Sped up MyJobs page — now filters by industry at DB level instead of client-side
